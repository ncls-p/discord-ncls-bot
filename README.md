# NCLS Bot
NCLS Bot is an open source Discord bot created to assist you in your daily tasks using the OpenAI GPT-3 model.

## Features
Current features of NCLS Bot include:

### Commands
- `help`: Displays the list of available commands
- `gpthelp`: Provides help from the OpenAI GPT-3 model
- `Gpthelp forgetAll` Forgets all the messages before the command was sent
- `ping`: Displays the bot's latency
- `info`: Displays information about the bot
- `createchannel`: Creates a private channel for the user and the bot

### Using the ToRespond Feature
The bot also has an automated response module that sends a predefined response when a specific keyword is used in the chat room. To use this feature, you can modify the `config.ts` file and add entries to the messagesInResponse array, following the format of the existing entries. The bot will then automatically respond with the message in key-word to the messages in the array as values.
